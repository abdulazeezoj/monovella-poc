# Guide: writing a good test for a new endpoint

This is the testing half of adding a new resource. For the
routing/schema/model half — the code under test — see the
`fastapi` skill's `guides/add-an-endpoint.md`.
For how `client` itself talks to the app in-process, see the
`fastapi` skill's `guides/testing.md`.
This guide only covers what makes a test *good* once you already have
a working `client`.

## One test per behavior

Split behaviors into separate test functions rather than one function
that asserts an entire flow end-to-end: `test_create_widget`,
`test_list_widgets`, `test_get_widget`,
`test_get_widget_missing_returns_404`, `test_delete_widget`. The
starter `test_item_crud` in `tests/test_main.py` chains
create → list → get → delete → get-again-expecting-404 into one
function to keep the initial scaffold short — read it as a compact
example of the behaviors worth covering, not as the shape to keep
copying as a resource grows. Once a resource has more going on than the
basic CRUD set, one test per behavior means a failing test's *name*
tells you what broke (`test_get_widget_missing_returns_404` failing is
unambiguous; a failure partway through one long combined test isn't).

## Assert the status code *and* the response body's shape

`assert response.status_code == 201` alone doesn't prove the response
body is right. Always also assert on
`response.json()`,
checking the fields that matter — not necessarily every field (an `id`
that's merely "some int" is often enough to check for presence), but
any field the caller sent should come back unchanged:

```python
async def test_create_widget(client: AsyncClient) -> None:
    response = await client.post(
        "/widgets/", json={"name": "Widget", "description": "A thing"}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 201
    body = response.json()
    assert body["name"] == "Widget"
    assert body["description"] == "A thing"
    assert "id" in body


async def test_get_widget_missing_returns_404(client: AsyncClient) -> None:
    response = await client.get("/widgets/999")
    assert response.status_code == 404
```

## The minimum behaviors worth a test

For any CRUD resource: create (2xx, body echoes the input), list (2xx,
the new item is present), get-by-id (2xx, the right item comes back),
get-by-id when missing (404), delete (2xx/204), and get-by-id again
after delete (404). `tests/test_main.py`'s `test_item_crud` covers
exactly this set for `items` in one combined function; give a new
resource the same coverage, split per the section above once there's
more than the basics worth testing.

## When the same behavior needs several inputs

If you find yourself about to write several near-identical test
functions that only differ in the input payload and the expected
outcome (several invalid payloads that should all 422, say), that's a
sign to reach for `@pytest.mark.parametrize` instead — see
`guides/parametrize.md`.
