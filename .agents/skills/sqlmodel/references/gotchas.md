# Gotchas

Real mistakes this project's own SQLModel templates hit while being built
and live-verified — not hypothetical, each one broke something concrete
before it was fixed. Worth knowing before you hit the same wall.

## A missing `await` doesn't error — it hands back a coroutine

Every session call that touches the database (`session.exec(...)`,
`session.get(...)`, `session.commit()`, `session.refresh(...)`,
`session.delete(...)`) is a coroutine function. Forget the `await` and
Python does not raise on that line:

```python
result = session.exec(select(Item))   # BUG: missing `await`
items = result.all()                  # AttributeError: 'coroutine' object has no attribute 'all'
```

`result` is silently a coroutine object, not a `ScalarResult`. The
failure surfaces one line later, on whatever you tried to do with the
"result" — and the error message (`'coroutine' object has no attribute
...`) doesn't mention `await` at all, so it reads like a completely
unrelated bug if you don't already know to check for a missing `await`.
Python also emits a `RuntimeWarning: coroutine '...' was never awaited`
at garbage-collection time, easy to miss in test output — if you ever see
that warning, it means a real database call in your change silently never
ran. When a query "returns nothing" or a write "doesn't seem to persist,"
check for a missing `await` on that call before assuming the query logic
is wrong.

## `.exec()`, not `.execute()`

Plain SQLAlchemy's `AsyncSession.execute(select(...))` returns a `Result`
you then call `.scalars()` on to get model instances back. SQLModel's
`AsyncSession` (`sqlmodel.ext.asyncio.session.AsyncSession` — see
`references/models-and-sessions.md` for the import) adds `.exec()`,
which does that unwrapping for you and returns model instances directly:

```python
# This project's pattern (SQLModel):
result = await session.exec(select(Item))
items = list(result.all())            # Item instances

# Plain SQLAlchemy's pattern — do NOT copy this here:
result = await session.execute(select(Item))
items = list(result.scalars().all())  # extra .scalars() step
```

`.execute()` still exists on SQLModel's session (it's inherited from
SQLAlchemy) and will *not* raise an error — it just returns rows wrapped
the SQLAlchemy way instead of the SQLModel way, which then breaks
`response_model=` validation or attribute access downstream in a way
that's confusing to trace back to "used the wrong method name." This trips
people up specifically because plain SQLAlchemy's own docs, Stack
Overflow answers, and LLM training data overwhelmingly show `.execute()`
— when you're working in this project's SQLModel layer, reach for
`.exec()` instead every time.

## Alembic needs the models actually imported

This project has `migrations=true`. Alembic's `env.py` sets
`target_metadata = SQLModel.metadata`, but that metadata object only
knows about tables whose model class has been imported *somewhere* in the
process — `env.py` imports `models.py` explicitly for exactly this
reason:

```python
from api.models import Item  # noqa: F401 - registers metadata
```

If you add a new model in a different module and it never gets imported
(directly or transitively) before `alembic revision --autogenerate` runs,
autogenerate won't see it and won't generate a migration for it — not an
error, just a quietly incomplete migration. Keep new models importable
from `models.py` (or make sure `env.py`'s import list picks up wherever
you put them). The migration workflow itself (generating, reviewing, and
running revisions) is covered in the `alembic` skill — this is only the
model-visibility half of that story.
