# Models & sessions

## A table model is one class, playing two roles

`SQLModel` subclasses do double duty: with `table=True`, the class is
*simultaneously* a Pydantic model (validation, `.model_dump()`, etc.) and
a SQLAlchemy-mapped table. `src/api/models.py`:

```python
from sqlmodel import Field, SQLModel

class Item(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int | None = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
```

- Plain type-annotated attributes (`name: str`) become both the Pydantic
  field and the table column — no separate `Column(...)` declarations for
  the common case.
- `Field(...)` is where you reach for anything SQLAlchemy needs that a
  bare annotation can't express: `primary_key=True`, `default=None` (a
  `None` default here means "let the database assign it" for an
  autoincrementing PK — the Python-side default and the DB-side behavior
  are two different things, don't confuse `Field(default=None)` with the
  column being nullable), `foreign_key="other.id"`, `index=True`, etc.
- `id: int | None` (optional at the Python level, `None` before insert)
  vs. the actual non-null integer column the database enforces — this is
  normal and matches every SQLModel example you'll find upstream, not a
  bug in this project's templates.

Adding a field is: add the annotation (+ `Field(...)` if it needs
anything beyond a plain column), then see the `migrations` note below —
a model change alone does not change the live schema.

## The async session lifecycle

`src/api/core/db.py` sets up the engine and session
factory once, at import time:

```python
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import async_sessionmaker, create_async_engine
from sqlmodel import SQLModel
from sqlmodel.ext.asyncio.session import AsyncSession

from api.core.config import settings

engine = create_async_engine(settings.database_url, echo=settings.debug)
async_session_maker = async_sessionmaker(engine, class_=AsyncSession, expire_on_commit=False)
```

Note the import: `AsyncSession` comes from `sqlmodel.ext.asyncio.session`,
*not* `sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio` — SQLModel's `AsyncSession` is the one with
`.exec()` on it (see `gotchas.md`). Mixing the two up is an easy paste
error if you're copying a snippet from plain SQLAlchemy docs.

`expire_on_commit=False` matters here: without it, every attribute on an
object you just committed would be lazily re-fetched from the database the
next time you touch it — and a lazy re-fetch on an *async* session outside
an active `await` context raises, rather than transparently blocking the
way sync SQLAlchemy would. Keep this flag as-is; don't remove it while
"simplifying" `db.py`.

`get_session()` yields exactly one session per request:

```python
async def get_session() -> AsyncGenerator[AsyncSession, None]:
    async with async_session_maker() as session:
        yield session
```

Every route depends on this via `Depends(get_session)` — see the
`fastapi` skill for the dependency-injection side. Never create a session
outside this pattern (e.g. a module-level session shared across requests)
— sessions are not thread/task-safe to share.

### The query/write cycle, from `routes/items.py`

```python
from sqlmodel import select
from sqlmodel.ext.asyncio.session import AsyncSession

# read many
result = await session.exec(select(Item))
items = list(result.all())

# read one by primary key
item = await session.get(Item, item_id)

# create
db_item = Item(**item_in.model_dump())
session.add(db_item)
await session.commit()
await session.refresh(db_item)   # populate db-assigned fields (id, defaults)

# delete
await session.delete(item)
await session.commit()
```

- `session.add()` is the one call in this list that is *not* awaited — it
  only stages the object in the session's identity map, no I/O happens
  yet. Everything that actually talks to the database (`exec`, `get`,
  `commit`, `refresh`, `delete`) is awaited.
- `await session.refresh(db_item)` after `commit()` is what makes the
  database-assigned `id` (and any other server-side default) available on
  the Python object you're about to return — skip it and you'll return an
  object with `id=None` even though the row now has a real id.
- Filtering/ordering compose onto `select()` the same way as plain
  SQLAlchemy Core: `select(Item).where(Item.name == name).order_by(Item.id)`
  — SQLModel's `select()` is SQLAlchemy's, re-exported.

## Why table models and API schemas stay separate types

`src/api/schemas.py` defines `ItemCreate`/`ItemRead` as
*plain* `pydantic.BaseModel` subclasses, deliberately not SQLModel
`table=False` models and deliberately not the same class as `Item` in
`models.py`, even though SQLModel is explicitly designed to let a single
model wear all three hats. This project keeps them separate on purpose:

- **What a client is allowed to send** and **what the database stores**
  usually diverge. `ItemCreate` has no `id` field — a client doesn't get
  to choose a primary key. As soon as a model grows a server-assigned or
  computed field (`created_at`, `owner_id` from the auth context, a
  hashed password vs. the plaintext one an endpoint accepts), a single
  shared type stops working and you're refactoring under pressure instead
  of from the start.
- **What a response exposes** and **what the table stores** also diverge
  once you add anything sensitive (a password hash, an internal flag) —
  `ItemRead` is an explicit allowlist of what leaves the process; the ORM
  model is not.
- Route handlers convert explicitly at the boundary —
  `Item(**item_in.model_dump())` on the way in,
  `response_model=ItemRead` against the ORM instance on the way out (see
  the `fastapi` skill's `references/routing-and-dependencies.md`) — so
  the divergence is a one-line conversion, not a design constraint you
  have to work around later.

If a resource is genuinely simple enough that request/response/table
really are identical today, it's still worth keeping the three types
distinct from the start — the cost of three small classes is much lower
than the cost of unwinding one shared class later.
