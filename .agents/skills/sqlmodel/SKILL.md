# SQLModel

This project's ORM is [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/) — a thin
layer over SQLAlchemy and Pydantic, from the same author as FastAPI. This
skill covers how *this project* uses it, not the whole library surface, so
you can add code that matches the existing conventions instead of
introducing a second style.

SQLModel is the default ORM for `fastapi`/`rest-api` (the other choice is
plain SQLAlchemy — see the `sqlalchemy` skill if that's what this project
uses instead; check `src/api/models.py` for `SQLModel` vs.
`declarative_base()` if you're unsure which applies). It is async-only in
this project — Flask's sync data layer uses plain SQLAlchemy or
flask-sqlalchemy instead.

## When to reach for this

- Defining a new table model, or adding/changing a field on an existing one.
- Writing a query (`select`, filtering, ordering) against the database.
- Touching `src/api/core/db.py` — engine, session factory,
  `init_db()`.
- Debugging a query that returns a coroutine instead of data, or an
  `AttributeError` that mentions `.execute()`.

## Quick reference

- **Models**: `src/api/models.py`. One class per table,
  inheriting `SQLModel` with `table=True` — this single class *is* both
  the Pydantic model and the SQLAlchemy table declaration:

  ```python
  from sqlmodel import Field, SQLModel

  class Item(SQLModel, table=True):
      id: int | None = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
      name: str
      description: str | None = None
  ```

- **Engine & sessions**: `src/api/core/db.py` builds an
  async engine (`create_async_engine`) and an `async_sessionmaker` bound to
  SQLModel's own `AsyncSession`
  (`from sqlmodel.ext.asyncio.session import AsyncSession` — not
  SQLAlchemy's). `get_session()` is the `Depends()`-able generator every
  route uses to get one session per request (see the `fastapi` skill's
  `references/routing-and-dependencies.md` for the dependency-injection
  side of this).
- **Querying**: `select(Model)` from `sqlmodel`, run with
  `await session.exec(...)` — **`.exec()`, not `.execute()`** (see
  `references/gotchas.md`). `session.get(Model, id)` for a primary-key
  lookup, `session.add()` / `await session.commit()` /
  `await session.refresh()` for writes.
- **Every session call that touches the database is awaited.** There is no
  sync fallback in this project's data layer — a call missing `await`
  doesn't error immediately, it hands back a coroutine object (see
  `references/gotchas.md`).
- **Table model vs. API schema**: the SQLModel class in `models.py` is the
  *table* model. `src/api/schemas.py` holds separate plain
  Pydantic models (`ItemCreate`, `ItemRead`) for what crosses the HTTP
  boundary — see `references/models-and-sessions.md` for why these aren't
  collapsed into one type even though SQLModel supports `table=False`
  models for exactly that.
- **Migrations**: this project has `migrations=true` — Alembic's
  `env.py` points `target_metadata` at `SQLModel.metadata` and imports
  `models.py` so Alembic can see the tables when autogenerating. The
  `alembic` skill covers the migration workflow itself; this skill only
  covers the model-definition side that autogenerate reads from.

## Go deeper

- `references/models-and-sessions.md` — field syntax, the async session
  lifecycle, and why table models and API schemas stay separate types.
- `references/gotchas.md` — the missing-`await` trap and the
  `.exec()`/`.execute()` naming mismatch, both real mistakes this
  project's own templates hit while being built.
- `guides/add-a-model.md` — defining a new table model end-to-end, with a
  pointer to the `fastapi` skill for wiring it into a router.
