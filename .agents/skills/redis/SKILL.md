# Redis

This project's Redis add-on (`redis=true`) gives you a ready-to-use
client for **caching** — a module-level `redis_client` you `get`/`set`/
`delete` against, nothing more. This skill covers how *this project*
uses `redis-py` for that, not the whole library surface.

## Caching Redis is independent of broker Redis

If a background worker was also chosen, it may *also* talk to Redis —
but as a message broker (`broker=redis`), wired up separately inside
the `taskiq` skill. That's a different client, a different connection,
a different concern, and this skill doesn't cover it. The two choices
are deliberately decoupled: picking `broker=redis` for the worker does
**not** by itself give you this caching client wired into your routes
(`redis=true` is its own prompt) — and picking `broker=rabbitmq` (or
having no worker at all) still leaves the caching-Redis question open,
it's just asked independently. If you see `redis_client` imported
anywhere, it's this skill's client, for caching; if you see a
broker/worker object talking to Redis, that's the other one.

## When to reach for this

- Caching an expensive or frequently-requested response.
- Invalidating a cached value after a create/update/delete.
- Debugging stale data being served after a write.
- Touching `src/api/core/redis.py`.

## Quick reference

- **Location**: `src/api/core/redis.py` — one
  module-level client, `redis_client`, built once at import time and
  imported wherever it's needed. Same reasoning as
  `core/config.py`'s module-level `settings` (see the
  `pydantic-settings` skill): constructing a client from a URL does no
  I/O by itself, so importing this module is always safe — the actual
  network connection is opened lazily, on the first real command.
- **Client**: `redis.asyncio.Redis`, built via
  `Redis.from_url(settings.redis_url, decode_responses=True)` — async,
  to match this project's async FastAPI handlers. Every call needs
  `await` (`await redis_client.get(...)`).
- **`decode_responses=True`**: values come back as `str`, not `bytes` —
  don't add your own `.decode()` calls, and remember to
  `json.dumps`/`json.loads` yourself for anything structured (the
  client doesn't serialize for you).
- **`redis_url` setting**: `src/api/core/config.py`'s
  `Settings.redis_url`, defaulting to `redis://localhost:6379/0`,
  overridable via `REDIS_URL` in `.env` — see the `pydantic-settings`
  skill for the loading mechanism.
- **Dependency**: plain `redis>=5.2.0` in `pyproject.toml` — no
  `hiredis` extra. `redis.asyncio` ships in the same package as the
  sync client; nothing extra to install for FastAPI's async usage.
- **Run it**: point `REDIS_URL` at a running Redis (`docker run -p
  6379:6379 redis` is the fastest local option) — there's no
  auto-provisioning here, unlike the SQLite database.

## Go deeper

- `references/redis-operations.md` — the `get`/`set`/`setex`/`delete`
  calls this project actually reaches for, with real signatures.
- `references/gotchas.md` — the sync/async client mismatch and the one
  thing caching always gets wrong (invalidation).
- `guides/add-caching-to-an-endpoint.md` — caching the `items` list
  response end-to-end, invalidation included.
