# Gotchas

## Don't reach for the sync `redis` client by mistake

`core/redis.py` imports from `redis.asyncio`, not plain `redis` — every
call on `redis_client` returns a coroutine and needs `await`. If you
ever import `redis.Redis` (the sync client) directly and call it from
inside an `async def` handler, it blocks the whole event loop for the
duration of that call — every other in-flight request stalls, not just
the one that made it. Same failure shape as a sync database driver
inside an async handler; see the `fastapi` skill's gotchas for the full
explanation, since the mechanism is identical. Low local traffic hides
this completely, so it's easy to ship without noticing until real
concurrent load hits it.

## Invalidation is the hard part, and this project doesn't do it for you

`core/redis.py` gives you a client and nothing else — no automatic
cache invalidation on writes. If you cache the `items` list response
(`GET /items/`) and then `create_item`/`delete_item` modifies the
underlying data, the cached response is now stale, and it stays stale
until its TTL expires — the app will silently keep serving the old list
until then. This project's own example (see
`guides/add-caching-to-an-endpoint.md`) handles it the simplest way
that's actually correct: every write handler that touches `items`
explicitly deletes the `"items:all"` cache key before returning, so the
next read is a real miss and repopulates the cache. There's no cleverer
default here (no cache-aside library, no write-through layer) — if you
add caching to a new resource, you're responsible for adding the
matching invalidation calls to every handler that writes to it. A TTL
is a safety net for when you forget, not a substitute for invalidating
correctly.

## A cache miss on Redis being down looks like a real bug

`redis_client` doesn't validate a connection at import time — the first
sign Redis isn't running is an exception on the first real `get`/`set`
call, not at startup. If caching-related errors show up only in some
environments, check that `REDIS_URL` actually points at a reachable
Redis before assuming the caching logic itself is wrong.
