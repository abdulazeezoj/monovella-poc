# The `Settings` class and `.env`

## The pattern

`src/api/core/config.py`:

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict


class Settings(BaseSettings):
    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_file=".env", extra="ignore")

    app_name: str = "api"
    debug: bool = False
    database_url: str = "postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/api"


settings = Settings()
```

Every field has a plain Python default, so the app runs with no `.env`
at all (fresh clone, CI, a quick `python -c "..."`) — `.env` and real
environment variables only *override* those defaults, they aren't
required for the app to boot.

`settings = Settings()` sits at **module scope**, so it runs exactly
once, the first time anything imports `core.config` — every other
module (`main.py`, `core/db.py`, `core/redis.py`, `worker.py`, `alembic/env.py`)
imports that same `settings` object rather than constructing its own.
Treat it as a singleton: never call `Settings()` again elsewhere in the
codebase, and never mutate `settings` at runtime — if a value needs to
differ per-call (tests, a one-off script), pass it as an explicit
argument instead (see `references/framework-integration.md` for how
Flask's `create_app()` does exactly that for the database URL).

## Why an eager singleton is safe here — and wouldn't be for a DB engine

Building `Settings()` at import time does real work (reads the
environment, reads `.env`, validates every field) but it is **pure and
side-effect-free**: no socket, no file lock, no network call. Importing
`core.config` — which `pytest`, `alembic`, or any tooling might do
incidentally — can never hang, fail on an unreachable service, or leave
a connection open. That's precisely why it's fine for `settings` to be
built eagerly at module scope, unlike a database engine or a broker
connection, which *do* carry I/O and are the reason this project's
FastAPI skill's gotchas warn against calling `init_db()` (or
anything that opens a connection) outside the `lifespan` hook. Settings parsing has no
such hazard, so there's no reason to defer it behind a factory or a
dependency.

## `.env` and `.env.example` are generated as a pair

The `env.jinja` template next to `config.py.jinja` renders to `.env`
(git-ignored — see `.gitignore`) — brupy's generator also copies that
same rendered content into a checked-in `.env.example` automatically,
so the two files always start byte-for-byte identical. This means:

- `.env.example` is not hand-maintained — it's a snapshot of whatever
  `.env` looked like at generation time (real-looking default values,
  not placeholders like `<your-value-here>`), so a teammate cloning the
  repo can `cp .env.example .env` and get a working local setup with
  zero edits for `sqlite`/no-broker configurations.
- If you add a field to `Settings`, add the matching line to
  `env.jinja` too (see `guides/add-a-setting.md`) — nothing keeps
  `.env`/`.env.example` and `Settings` in sync automatically after
  generation; that sync only happens once, at project-generation time.
- Never commit real secrets into `.env` thinking `.env.example` stays
  clean — for this project's generation-time mechanism, whatever is in
  `.env` when it's generated *is* what lands in `.env.example` too.
  Rotate any placeholder credential before it becomes a real one.

## Validation happens at import time, and that's the point

`Settings()` runs pydantic's normal validation the moment it's
constructed — type coercion, required-field checks — and because that
construction happens at **module import time**, a misconfigured
environment fails immediately when the app (or `pytest`, or `alembic`)
starts up, with a clear `pydantic_core.ValidationError` naming the
offending field. Compare that to a config system that returns `None`
for a missing value and lets it propagate: the failure would surface
later, disconnected from its cause, deep inside whatever handler first
touched the bad value. Fail fast at startup, not confusingly at
request time — that's the tradeoff this pattern is choosing.
