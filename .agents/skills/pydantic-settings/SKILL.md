# pydantic-settings

This project's configuration is always on: `core/config.py`'s `Settings`
class is the single source of typed, validated app configuration,
loaded from environment variables (and `.env`) once at import time.
This skill covers how *this project* uses `pydantic-settings` — not
the whole library surface — so a new setting matches the existing
pattern instead of introducing a second way to configure the app.

## When to reach for this

- Adding a new setting (a URL, a flag, a credential, a tunable).
- Wiring a new integration that needs a connection string or API key.
- Debugging a startup error that looks like a validation failure
  (missing field, wrong type) rather than a runtime bug.
- Understanding why `.env.example` always matches `.env` in this repo.

## Quick reference

- **Location**: `src/api/core/config.py`. One class,
  `Settings(BaseSettings)`, and one module-level instance,
  `settings = Settings()`, built once at import time and imported
  wherever a config value is needed — never re-instantiated per
  request.
- **Config source**: `model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_file=".env",
  extra="ignore")` — fields are populated from real environment
  variables first, falling back to `.env` (git-ignored — see
  `references/settings-and-env.md`), then each field's Python default.
  `extra="ignore"` means an unrelated env var in `.env` is silently
  skipped rather than raising.
- **Field naming**: a `snake_case` field on `Settings` maps to its
  `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` env var by default (`database_url` ↔
  `DATABASE_URL`) — no explicit `alias=` needed for the fields this
  project ships with.
- **Fields this project has**: `app_name`, `debug`, always
; `database_url`, since a
  database was chosen — see `core/config.py` for the
  exact list, since it's shaped by the options this project was
  generated with.
- **`.env` / `.env.example`**: brupy auto-mirrors whatever it writes to
  `.env` into a checked-in `.env.example` at generation time, so the
  two always start identical — see `references/settings-and-env.md`
  before editing either by hand.

## Go deeper

- `references/settings-and-env.md` — the `Settings` class pattern in
  full, the `.env`/`.env.example` mechanism, and why validating at
  import time is the right tradeoff here.
- `references/framework-integration.md` — how FastAPI code
  actually reaches for `settings`, and the one real difference between
  FastAPI's and Flask's access pattern.
- `guides/add-a-setting.md` — the concrete steps to add a new setting
  end-to-end (field, env var, consumer).
