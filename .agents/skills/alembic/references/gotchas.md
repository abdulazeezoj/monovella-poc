# Gotchas

Two real, project-specific ways Alembic breaks here — not hypothetical,
the second one was an actual bug in this project's own templates before
it was fixed. Both are invisible to `uv sync && uv run pytest`, which
never touches Alembic at all, so they stay hidden until someone actually
runs a migration command.

## `prepend_sys_path` must be `src`, not `.`

This project uses a `src/` layout
(`src/api/...`), and `alembic.ini` reflects that:

```ini
[alembic]
script_location = alembic
prepend_sys_path = src
```

`env.py` does `from api.core.config import settings` and
`from api.models import ...` — those imports only resolve
because `prepend_sys_path = src` puts `src/` on `sys.path` before `env.py`
runs. If this ever gets "cleaned up" to `prepend_sys_path = .` (Alembic's
own default template, written for a flat layout) or removed entirely,
one of two things happens, and neither is subtle once you're looking for
it but both are confusing the first time:

- Most commonly, `alembic revision --autogenerate` fails outright with
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'api'` — loud,
  easy to trace back to this line.
- Less obviously, if `api` happens to *also* be importable
  some other way (e.g. installed in the active environment from a
  previous `uv sync`/editable install), the import silently succeeds
  against a **stale installed copy** instead of the checked-out source —
  autogenerate then diffs against the wrong models and can produce an
  empty migration, or one missing your latest change, with no error at
  all.

If `alembic revision --autogenerate` can't find your models, or produces
an empty migration when you know you changed one, check this line first.

## Migrations are decorative if anything else also creates tables

This is the single most important rule once Alembic is in the picture:
**application code must never create tables outside migration history.**
Concretely — nothing in `src/api/` may call
`SQLModel.metadata.create_all(...)`
(or `conn.run_sync(...create_all)`) at app startup once `migrations=true`.

This was a real bug in this exact project, not a theoretical one: the
app's own startup code called `create_all()` unconditionally, regardless
of whether Alembic was enabled. The failure mode is quiet and easy to
mistake for "everything's fine":

1. The app boots, `create_all()` runs, the tables now exist — but
   `alembic_version` (the table Alembic uses to track which migrations
   have actually been applied) was never stamped, because no migration
   ever ran.
2. Someone runs `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "..."` expecting it
   to capture the initial schema. It compares the models against the
   *live database* — which, thanks to step 1, already matches the models
   exactly — and reports **"No changes in schema detected."** No
   migration file is written. The project now looks like it has
   migrations (the directory, the config, the workflow) but doesn't: no
   revision has ever actually run.
3. On a genuinely fresh database where `create_all()` hasn't run yet,
   `alembic upgrade head` would eventually try to create tables that
   already exist by the time anyone gets around to writing that first
   migration — a `DuplicateTable`-style failure, or worse, a mismatch
   between what the migration thinks it's creating and what's actually
   there.

**The fix in this project**: when `migrations=true`,
`src/api/main.py` deliberately does **not** import or
call `init_db()` at all — not "call it conditionally," genuinely not
imported, so there's no code path left that could accidentally invoke
it. Schema comes solely from `uv run alembic upgrade head`. See
`main.py`'s imports: `init_db` only appears there when `not migrations`.
If you're adding new startup code near the database, follow the same
rule: check `migrations` before doing anything that could create or
alter schema, or better, don't gate it at all and just never call
`create_all()` once migrations exist for real (non-test) code paths.

**If you inherit a project where this already happened** (autogenerate
keeps saying "No changes detected" and you know that's wrong): the
database has schema with no migration history behind it. The way out is
to either drop and recreate the database, then run
`guides/first-migration.md`'s two commands against it, or hand-write a
migration that matches the current live schema and
`alembic stamp head` it — don't try to "fix" this by adding a
`create_all()` call back into application code.
