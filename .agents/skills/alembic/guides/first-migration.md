# Guide: the first migration on a fresh database

Run this once, before starting the app for the first time — the same
two commands the project's own `README.md` documents:

```
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe your change"
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

The first run captures the initial schema straight from
`src/api/models.py` (the `Item` model, plus anything else
you've added there) and applies it — after this, the database has both
the tables *and* a migration history that starts from a real revision,
not from tables that happen to already exist (see
`references/gotchas.md` for why that distinction matters).

## Why both commands, every time

- `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "..."` only **writes a migration
  file** to `alembic/versions/` — it diffs the current models against
  the last-known schema state and generates `upgrade()`/`downgrade()`
  functions to bridge the difference (see
  `guides/reading-a-migration.md` for what that file looks like). It
  does not touch the database.
- `alembic upgrade head` is what actually **applies** pending migrations
  to the database and stamps `alembic_version` with the new revision.

Skipping the second command leaves you with a migration file on disk and
an untouched database — running the app will fail with "table does not
exist" errors, which is a common enough mix-up to check first if that
happens.

## Repeat both commands whenever you change a model

Add a column, add a table, change a constraint — every model change
gets its own migration, generated and applied the same way, with a
message describing that specific change:

```
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add email to item"
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

**Review the generated file before running `upgrade head`** — see
`guides/reading-a-migration.md`. Don't skip this because the first
migration "just worked": autogenerate is diffing your models against
schema state, and a rename, a subtle constraint change, or a
multi-column index can autogenerate into something other than what you
intended.

## Rolling back

`uv run alembic downgrade -1` undoes exactly one revision (runs that
revision's `downgrade()`). `uv run alembic history` shows the full
chain of revisions in order; `uv run alembic current` shows which one
the database is actually on right now — useful when the two have drifted
(e.g. after pulling a teammate's new migration you haven't applied yet).
