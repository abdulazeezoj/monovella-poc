# Guide: what a generated migration file looks like

Every `alembic revision --autogenerate` run writes a new file under
`alembic/versions/`, named `<revision-id>_<slugified-message>.py`. This
is what to expect in it, so you can sanity-check one before running
`alembic upgrade head` — reviewing the file is part of the normal
workflow here, not an optional extra step.

## Shape of the file

```python
"""add email to item

Revision ID: 8f3c1a2b9d40
Revises: 4a1e7c0d2f11
Create Date: 2026-08-13 10:22:04.123456

"""

from typing import Sequence, Union

import sqlalchemy as sa
import sqlmodel
from alembic import op

# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision: str = "8f3c1a2b9d40"
down_revision: Union[str, None] = "4a1e7c0d2f11"
branch_labels: Union[str, Sequence[str], None] = None
depends_on: Union[str, Sequence[str], None] = None


def upgrade() -> None:
    op.add_column("item", sa.Column("email", sa.String(), nullable=True))


def downgrade() -> None:
    op.drop_column("item", "email")
```

- **The docstring and filename** come from your `-m "..."` message —
  that's the only part you write by hand; everything else is generated.
- **`revision` / `down_revision`** form a linked list of migrations —
  `down_revision` points at whatever revision was "head" when this file
  was generated. This is how `alembic upgrade head` knows the order to
  apply things in, and how `alembic history` reconstructs the chain.
  Don't hand-edit these unless you're deliberately resolving a branch
  (two migrations generated with the same `down_revision`, usually from
  a merge) — see `alembic merge` in Alembic's own docs if that happens.
- **`upgrade()`** contains the actual schema change, expressed as `op.*`
  calls — `op.create_table(...)`, `op.add_column(...)`,
  `op.alter_column(...)`, `op.create_index(...)`, `op.drop_column(...)`,
  and so on. This is what `alembic upgrade head` executes.
- **`downgrade()`** is the inverse, executed by `alembic downgrade -1`.
  Autogenerate fills this in too, but check it as carefully as
  `upgrade()` — an inverse that doesn't actually undo the change (e.g. a
  dropped column's data is gone for good, even though `downgrade()` can
  re-add the column) is a real trap, not just a style nitpick.

## A brand-new table looks like this

The first migration in a project (see `guides/first-migration.md`)
typically generates a full `op.create_table(...)` per model:

```python
def upgrade() -> None:
    op.create_table(
        "item",
        sa.Column("id", sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column("name", sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint("id"),
    )


def downgrade() -> None:
    op.drop_table("item")
```

## What to actually check before applying

- **Does every `op.*` call match the model change you intended?** A
  migration that touches a table you didn't mean to touch usually means
  a model elsewhere drifted from the database's last-known state (often
  because someone forgot to generate a migration for an earlier change —
  see `references/gotchas.md` if the drift is because tables were
  created outside migration history entirely).
- **Renamed columns/tables**: autogenerate cannot reliably tell a rename
  apart from a drop-and-add — `sa.Column("full_name", ...)` replacing
  `sa.Column("name", ...)` will typically show up as
  `op.drop_column("item", "name")` + `op.add_column("item",
  sa.Column("full_name", ...))`, which **drops existing data** in
  `name` on `upgrade()` instead of preserving it. If you actually
  renamed a column, hand-edit the migration to use
  `op.alter_column("item", "name", new_column_name="full_name")`
  instead of accepting the generated drop/add.
- **Constraint and type changes**: some (a `nullable=True` →
  `nullable=False` change on a column with existing `NULL` rows, some
  `CHECK`/`UNIQUE` constraint changes depending on the database backend)
  need a data migration or an explicit default alongside the schema
  change, which autogenerate won't write for you — it only knows about
  schema, not data.
- **Empty `upgrade()`/`downgrade()` (just `pass`)**: means autogenerate
  detected no difference between your models and the last-known schema.
  If you changed a model and expected a real migration, see
  `references/gotchas.md` — this is the signature of either the
  `create_all()` gotcha or a model that isn't reachable from `env.py`'s
  imports.
