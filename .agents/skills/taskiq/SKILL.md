description: Async task queue conventions for this project's Taskiq worker — broker setup, task discovery, and the .kiq() enqueue pattern. Use when adding a background task, wiring a new tasks/ module, or debugging a task the worker doesn't seem to know about.

# Taskiq

This project offloads background work to [Taskiq](https://taskiq-python.github.io/),
an async-first task queue that matches FastAPI's async model (the sync
counterpart, Celery, is the other `worker` choice for projects that want
it — see the `celery` skill instead, if that's what this project has).
This skill covers how *this project* wires Taskiq — not the whole
library surface — so a new task lands the same way the existing one
does.

## When to reach for this

- Adding a new background task (a new function under
  `src/api/tasks/`).
- Enqueuing a task from a route handler (`.kiq(...)`) instead of running
  it inline.
- Touching `src/api/worker.py` — broker construction, or
  the task-module imports at the bottom of the file.
- Debugging "task not found" / an empty task list when the worker
  process starts — see `references/gotchas.md` first, this is almost
  always the cause.

## Quick reference

- **Broker**: `src/api/worker.py` builds one module-level
  `broker` object. This project uses Redis
  (`ListQueueBroker`, from `taskiq-redis`), pointed at
  `settings.redis_url`. The URL comes from `core/config.py`
  (env-overridable via `.env`) — the broker itself doesn't need any
  further backend-specific tuning to get started.
- **Tasks**: one (or more) plain `async def` functions per file under
  `src/api/tasks/`, each decorated `@broker.task`. See
  `tasks/example.py` for the shape.
- **Two ways to call a `@broker.task` function**: `await add(1, 2)` runs
  it inline, in whichever process called it, like any other function.
  `await add.kiq(1, 2)` *enqueues* it on the broker instead — it returns
  immediately with a `TaskiqTask` (not the result), and a separate
  worker process picks the task up and actually runs it. `main.py`'s
  `/tasks/add` endpoint uses `.kiq(...)`, which is the point of having a
  worker at all: the request returns instantly instead of blocking on
  the task's own runtime.
- **Two independent processes**: the API process (`fastapi dev`/`fastapi
  run`) only ever enqueues — it never runs a task's body itself. The
  worker process, started separately with
  `uv run taskiq worker api.worker:broker --app-dir src`,
  is what actually executes tasks. Nothing in the API process blocks
  waiting for a task to finish unless you explicitly await the
  `TaskiqTask`'s result.
- **Startup/shutdown**: `main.py`'s `lifespan` hook calls
  `broker.startup()`/`broker.shutdown()`, guarded by `if not
  broker.is_worker_process`. The same `broker` object is imported by
  both processes — the worker process manages its own startup/shutdown
  internally, so the API process must skip it or the two would race
  each other on the same connection setup.

## Go deeper

- `references/broker-and-tasks.md` — the broker construction per
  `broker` choice, the `@broker.task`/`.kiq()` distinction in more
  depth, and how tests should (and shouldn't) touch any of this.
- `references/gotchas.md` — the task-discovery trap this project's own
  worker template was built to avoid, and why the fix looks the way it
  does.
- `guides/add-a-task.md` — the concrete steps to add a new background
  task end-to-end (task function, wiring, enqueue endpoint).
