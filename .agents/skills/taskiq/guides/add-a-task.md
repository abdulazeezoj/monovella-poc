# Guide: add a new background task

Walks through adding a `send_email` task end-to-end, following the same
shape as the existing `add` task in `tasks/example.py` — copy that
shape for any new task rather than inventing a new one.

## 1. Write the task

Create `src/api/tasks/email.py`:

```python
from api.worker import broker


@broker.task
async def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str) -> None:
    ...  # do the actual send here
```

Import `broker` from `worker.py` — never construct a second broker, and
never import a *different* task module from here (that risks the same
circular-import shape `worker.py` avoids by importing tasks last; see
`references/gotchas.md`).

## 2. Wire it into `worker.py`

In `src/api/worker.py`, add an import for the new module
at the **bottom** of the file, alongside the existing `tasks.example`
import:

```python
from api.tasks import example  # noqa: E402,F401
from api.tasks import email  # noqa: E402,F401
```

This is the step it's easiest to forget — nothing else in the project
will catch a missed import here (see `references/gotchas.md`). Do this
in the same commit as step 1, not as a follow-up.

## 3. Enqueue it from a route

Wherever the task should be triggered from, import the task function
and call `.kiq(...)` — mirror `main.py`'s `/tasks/add` endpoint:

```python
from api.tasks.email import send_email

@router.post("/notify")
async def notify(to: str) -> dict[str, str]:
    task = await send_email.kiq(to, "Welcome", "Thanks for signing up!")
    return {"task_id": task.task_id}
```

Don't `await send_email(...)` directly from a route unless you actually
want the request to block until the send completes — that defeats the
point of having a worker.

## 4. Run a worker to pick it up

```
uv run taskiq worker api.worker:broker --app-dir src
```

Needs Redis running and reachable at `REDIS_URL` (see `.env`).
Watch the worker's own startup log for the new task's name — if
`send_email` doesn't show up in what it reports knowing about, the
import in step 2 is the first thing to check.

## 5. Test it

Add a test that calls the task function directly (not `.kiq(...)`,
since nothing consumes the queue during `uv run pytest` — see
`references/broker-and-tasks.md`):

```python
async def test_send_email():
    await send_email("user@example.com", "Welcome", "Thanks for signing up!")
    # assert on whatever side effect send_email has (mock the actual send)
```

For the endpoint itself, assert on the response shape the same way
`tests/test_main.py` does for `/tasks/add` — a `200` and a `task_id` in
the body, not that the task actually ran (it won't, in-process, during
tests).
