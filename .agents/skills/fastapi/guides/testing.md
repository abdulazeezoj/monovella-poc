# Guide: how this project's tests talk to the app

```
uv run pytest
```

## No running server, no real network

Tests use `httpx.AsyncClient` with `ASGITransport(app=app)` (see
`tests/conftest.py` / `tests/test_main.py`) — requests go
directly into the FastAPI app in-process, no socket, no `fastapi dev`
running in the background. This is faster and more deterministic than
hitting a real port, and it's why `client` is an `async` fixture and
every test function using it is `async def`.

## The database is swapped, not the real one

`tests/conftest.py` builds its own `test_engine` pointed at
`sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:` and overrides the `get_session`
dependency (`app.dependency_overrides[get_session] = ...`) so every
request during a test uses that isolated in-memory database — never
whatever `DATABASE_URL` is configured in `.env`. This is deliberate:
the suite must be runnable with zero external services, regardless of
which database was chosen at generation time. Schema for that
in-memory database is created directly in an autouse fixture
(`SQLModel.metadata.create_all`/`Base.metadata.create_all`), not
through `init_db()` — `init_db()` is never called during tests at all
(see the gotcha below).

## `lifespan` doesn't run during tests, on purpose

`ASGITransport` does not trigger FastAPI's `lifespan` startup/shutdown
hooks by default, so `init_db()` (and, any broker startup, if applicable) never
executes during the test suite — which is exactly why `conftest.py`
manages its own test database instead of relying on `init_db()`. If a
test genuinely needs the lifespan to run (rare — usually only if you're
testing startup/shutdown behavior itself), wrap the client fixture in
`asgi_lifespan.LifespanManager`; don't reach for it by default, since
it would mean the suite touches whatever `init_db()` touches.

## Adding a test for a new endpoint

Mirror `tests/test_main.py`: an `async def test_...(client)` function
using the `client` fixture, asserting on `response.status_code` and
`response.json()`. One test per behavior (create, list, get-by-id,
404-when-missing, delete) rather than one large test asserting
everything — a failure then points at exactly what broke.
