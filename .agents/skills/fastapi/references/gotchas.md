# Gotchas

Real mistakes brupy's own FastAPI templates hit while being built and
live-verified — not hypothetical, each one broke something concrete
before it was fixed. Worth knowing before you hit the same wall.

## `fastapi dev`/`fastapi run` needs a top-level `__init__.py`

`src/api/__init__.py` isn't decorative. Plain Python
imports and `pytest` both tolerate a missing one via PEP 420 namespace
packages, so `uv run pytest` staying green tells you nothing here — but
`fastapi_cli`'s own directory-walk logic (what `fastapi dev`/`fastapi
run` use to find the app) needs it to correctly locate the `src/` root.
Without it, the CLI silently computes the *wrong* root and the dev
server fails to start or watches the wrong directory. If you add a new
top-level package under `src/` for some reason, give it an
`__init__.py` even if nothing seems to need it yet.

## The database is *not* auto-created when migrations are on

This project has `migrations=true`: `main.py` deliberately does **not**
call `init_db()` at all (it's not even imported) — schema comes solely
from `alembic upgrade head`. If you're seeing "table does not exist"
errors, that's why: run the migration first (see the `alembic` skill's
`guides/first-migration.md`), don't add a `create_all()` call back into
`main.py`'s startup path to "fix" it.

## `lifespan` is the only correct place for startup/shutdown work

Don't call `await init_db()` (or start a broker, warm a cache, etc.) at
module scope in `main.py` — module import must stay side-effect-free,
since `pytest`, `alembic`, and any tooling that merely imports the
module would trigger it. The `lifespan` async context manager (wired
into `FastAPI(..., lifespan=lifespan)`) is the one place this project
runs startup/shutdown code, and it only runs when the app actually
boots (`fastapi dev`/`fastapi run`, or a test that explicitly drives
the ASGI lifespan protocol — see `guides/testing.md`, since the default
test setup here does *not* trigger it, on purpose).

## Sync database drivers block the event loop

If you ever hand-roll a database call outside the `sqlmodel`/
`sqlalchemy` skill's async session pattern, make sure the driver is
actually async (`asyncpg`, `aiosqlite`) — a sync driver call
(`psycopg2`, plain `sqlite3`) inside an `async def` handler blocks the
whole event loop for every other in-flight request, not just the one
that made the call. This is easy to miss locally (low traffic hides
it) and shows up as mysterious latency spikes under real load.
