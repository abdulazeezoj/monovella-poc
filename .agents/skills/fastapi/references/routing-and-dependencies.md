# Routing & dependencies

## Router structure

Every resource gets its own file under `src/api/routes/`,
exporting a single `router = APIRouter(prefix="/items", tags=["items"])`
(swap `items` for the resource name). `main.py` registers it once:

```python
from api.routes.items import router as items_router
app.include_router(items_router)
```

Route handlers are plain functions decorated with `@router.get(...)`,
`@router.post(...)`, etc. — `HTTPException` for error responses,
`response_model=` to declare the shape of a successful response
(FastAPI uses it to filter/validate the return value *and* to generate
the OpenAPI schema — always set it for anything that isn't `204`).

## Sync vs. async handlers

Both are valid — FastAPI runs a `def` handler in a thread pool and an
`async def` handler on the event loop directly. The rule in this
project: **a handler is `async def` the moment it awaits anything**
(a database call, an HTTP client, `asyncio.sleep`, ...). A handler with
no I/O (the in-memory `hello-world` routes, before a database is
chosen) stays a plain `def` — making it `async def` for no reason adds
nothing and is easy to get wrong later by awaiting inside a sync
context by mistake.

## Dependency injection with `Depends()`

The database session is the canonical example in this project —
`core/db.py` defines `get_session()`, a generator/async-generator
dependency:

```python
# core/db.py
async def get_session() -> AsyncGenerator[AsyncSession, None]:
    async with async_session_maker() as session:
        yield session

# routes/items.py
@router.get("/", response_model=list[ItemRead])
async def list_items(session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_session)) -> list[Item]:
    result = await session.exec(select(Item))
    return list(result.all())
```

`Depends(get_session)` is re-evaluated per request — each request gets
its own session, opened and closed around exactly that request's work,
never shared across requests or held longer than needed. Follow this
same shape for any other per-request resource (a request-scoped cache
client, a per-request auth context): a generator dependency that
`yield`s the resource and does cleanup after.

For anything that should be computed *once* (settings, a Redis
connection pool), don't use `Depends()` at all — see
`core/config.py`'s module-level `settings = Settings()` and (if Redis
was chosen) `core/redis.py`'s module-level client. `Depends()` is for
per-request values, not app-lifetime singletons.

## Request/response models

`schemas.py` holds the Pydantic models that cross the HTTP boundary —
`ItemCreate` (what a client sends) and `ItemRead` (what the API
returns) are deliberately separate types even though they overlap,
because the fields a client is allowed to set and the fields a
response exposes usually diverge in a real project (an `id`, a
`created_at`, a computed field) — starting with two types instead of
one avoids a bigger refactor later. If a database was chosen, the ORM
model (`models.py`) is a third, distinct type — route handlers convert
between them (`Item(**item.model_dump())`, `response_model=ItemRead`
against the ORM instance), never expose the ORM model directly as a
response type.

## Error handling

Raise `HTTPException(status_code=..., detail=...)` from inside a
handler — FastAPI turns it into the right JSON error response
automatically. Don't catch it further up; let it propagate. For a
class of error that recurs across many handlers, a custom exception +
an `@app.exception_handler(...)` on `app` in `main.py` is the pattern
to reach for instead of repeating the same `try`/`except` in every
route.
