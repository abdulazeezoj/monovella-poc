# FastAPI

This project's web layer is FastAPI. This skill covers how *this
project* uses it — not the whole library surface — so you can add
code that matches the existing conventions instead of introducing a
second style.

## When to reach for this

- Adding, changing, or removing an HTTP endpoint.
- Adding a new dependency (`Depends(...)`) — e.g. a new shared resource
  like a session, a cache client, or an auth check.
- Touching `src/api/main.py` — app construction, startup/
  shutdown behavior, router registration.
- Debugging a validation error, a 422 response, or an async/sync
  mismatch in a route handler.

## Quick reference

- **App entrypoint**: `src/api/main.py`. The `FastAPI(...)`
  instance is built once, at module scope — importing this module is
  always safe (no I/O happens on import).
- **Routers**: one file per resource under `src/api/routes/`,
  each exporting an `APIRouter` named `router`, included in `main.py` via
  `app.include_router(...)`. Don't add routes directly on `app` outside
  `main.py`'s own `/` health-check route — every resource gets its own
  router file, even a small one.
- **Request/response models**: `src/api/schemas.py` (or
  the ORM models themselves, for the simplest cases) — never accept or
  return a bare `dict` for a real resource; a Pydantic model is what
  gives you validation and the OpenAPI schema for free.
- **Run it**: `uv run fastapi dev src/api/main.py` — the
  `fastapi` CLI, not `uvicorn` directly. `fastapi dev` adds autoreload
  and a friendlier startup banner; `fastapi run` is its production-mode
  equivalent (see the Dockerfile if `--docker` was chosen).
- **Interactive docs**: `/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/redoc`, generated
  automatically from your routers' type hints — free, don't hand-write
  API docs that would just drift from these.

## Go deeper

- `references/routing-and-dependencies.md` — router structure,
  `Depends()` patterns, request/response models, error handling.
- `references/gotchas.md` — real mistakes this project's own templates
  hit while being built, and why the fix looks the way it does.
- `guides/add-an-endpoint.md` — the concrete steps to add a new
  resource end-to-end (router, schema, registration, test).
- `guides/testing.md` — how this project's test suite talks to the app
  without a running server.
